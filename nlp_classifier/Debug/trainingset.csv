classA|"ESMA, in line with the CP, proposes to retain the amendment to the current Table 1 in Annex II of Implementing Regulation (EC) No 1287/2006 for the purpose of establishing the content of pre-trade information that trading venues shall make public depending on the type of trading system operated, extending the requirements to actionable indication of interests (IOIs) which are, according to Article 2(1)(33) of MiFIR, messages between members or participants of a trading venues containing all the necessary information to agree to a trade."
classB|"ESMA also proposes to retain the definition of RFQ systems as presented in the CP with one caveat, publishing quotes will be part of the requirements instead of part of the definition. Additionally, and in order to provide further flexibility and to avoid that members or participants who are providing their quotes to the requester first are put at a disadvantage, the final draft RTS allows for the publication of all submitted quotes in response to a RFQ at the same time, i.e. once all quotes have been provided and the moment they become executable, whereas in the CP ESMA proposed that those systems should disclose all executable bids and offers the moment they are received."
classC|"Under MiFIR, systems operating a trading methodology where orders are matched on the basis of a price derived from another system (the so-called reference price) can operate under a pre-trade transparency waiver provided that certain conditions are met. Firstly, the reference price must be widely published and regarded by market participants as a reliable reference price. Secondly, the set of eligible prices for matching orders within the systems operated by the trading venue is limited to the mid-point within the current bid and offer price or where not available, the opening or the closing price of the relevant session. Finally, the reference price can only be sourced from the trading venue where that financial instrument was first admitted to trading or the most relevant market in terms of liquidity."
classE|"MiFIR empowers ESMA to draft regulatory technical standards specifying the most relevant market in terms of liquidity for the purpose of the reference price waiver. In the CP, ESMA noted that the concept of the most relevant market in terms of liquidity is also relevant in the context of the obligation of investment firms to report transactions under Article 26 MiFIR. However, in the CP, ESMA emphasised the different purposes of the most relevant market in terms of liquidity for transaction reporting and for pre-trade transparency and proposed to adopt two different definitions. In the CP, ESMA proposed that the most relevant market in terms of liquidity for a financial instrument should be the trading venue with the highest level of liquidity for that financial instrument measured by the total value of transactions executed by the trading venue during the relevant calendar year. ESMA also proposed, in order to strike an appropriate compromise between accuracy and operational costs, that the determination of the most relevant market in terms of liquidity would occur on an annual basis."
classE|"With respect to negotiated transactions, MiFIR empowers ESMA to draft RTS specifying (i) the characteristics of a negotiated transaction in relation to the different ways the member or participant of a trading venue can execute such a transaction and (ii) the negotiated transactions that do not contribute to price formation which avail the waiver provided for under Article 4(1)(b)(iii) of MiFIR."
classC|"In the CP, ESMA clarified that negotiated transactions shall be executed under the rules of a trading venue and negotiated privately by members or participants of a trading venue and that negotiated trades shall not be restricted to transactions between members or participants dealing on own account but may involve a client or clients of the member or participants. For that reason, and consistently with the existing framework for negotiated transactions under the Implementing Regulation (EC) No 1287/2006, ESMA proposed that a member or participant of a trading venue can execute such a negotiated transaction by undertaking one of the following tasks:"
classC|dealing on own account with another member or participant who acts for the account of a client;
classC|"dealing with another member or participant, where both are executing orders on own account;"
classC|acting for the account of both the buyer and seller;
classC|"acting for the account of the buyer, where another member or participant acts for the account of the seller; and"
classC|trading for own account against a client order.
classD|"is executed in reference to a price that is calculated over multiple time instances according to a given benchmark, such as volume-weighted average price or time-weighted average price;"
classD|is part of a portfolio trade that involves the execution of 10 or more financial instruments from the same client and at the same time and the components of the trade are meant to be executed only as a single lot;
classD|is a give-up or a give-in;
classD|is contingent on a derivative contract having the same underlying and where all the components of the trade are meant to be executed only as a single lot; or
classD|is contingent on technical characteristics of the transaction which are unrelated to the current market valuation of that financial instrument.
classE|"Most respondents were in favour of the inclusion of non-standard/special settlement trades to the list of transactions that do not contribute to the price formation process. However, after careful consideration, ESMA remains unconvinced that the arguments brought forward during the consultation constitute sufficient legitimate reasons to consider those transactions as not contributing to the price formation process. ESMA is also concerned about the potential risk of circumvention such an inclusion would represent and, hence, has decided not to add those types of transactions to its list."
classF|ESMA proposes to amend the specific characteristics of a negotiated transaction in relation to the different ways a member or participant of a trading venue can execute such transaction in order to include instances when an investment firm is dealing on behalf of a client.
classF|"The order management facility waiver refers to functionalities operated by trading venues where certain orders are exempted from pre-trade transparency pending their disclosure to the market (i.e. subject to being released to an order book prior execution). In absence of more specific requirements under MiFID I, CAs and ESMA have elaborated opinions aimed at ensuring supervisory convergence on the set of functionalities deemed to be compliant with the waiver. In accordance with those opinions, contingent orders such as reserve or iceberg orders and stop orders are currently considered orders held on an order management facility compliant with MiFID I."
classE|MiFIR empowers ESMA to draft RTS specifying the type and minimum size of orders held in an order management facility.
classD|"ESMA proposes to retain the proposed definition of the relevant characteristics of orders held in an order management facility and not to restrict it to reserve and stop orders. With regard to the minimum size, ESMA maintains the proposal set in the CP that for all orders held in an order management facility, including stop orders, the minimum size should be, at the point of entry of the order, the minimum tradable quantity established by the trading venue. For reserve orders, the minimum size should be, at the point of entry and following any amendment, not smaller than EUR 10,000."
classA|"Under MiFID I, orders that are large in scale (LIS) can benefit from a waiver from pre-trade transparency. The waiver is designed to protect large orders from adverse market impact and to avoid abrupt price movements that can cause market distortions. MiFIR recognises that mandatory public display of large orders can increase execution costs to the detriment of market liquidity and end-investors."
classE|"MiFIR empowers ESMA to draft RTS to specify the size of orders that are LIS compared with normal market size for each class of shares, depositary receipts, ETFs, certificates and other similar financial instruments."
classD|"In the CP ESMA proposed to adopt for all equity and equity-like financial instruments an approach using the average daily turnover (ADT) as a proxy for liquidity and market impact and allowing, for each financial instrument, the calibration of orders which may be considered LIS compared to the normal market size on this basis."
classD|"The second group of responses reiterated the arguments put forward in the responses to the DP against the use of the ADT which is viewed as a too simplistic measure of liquidity and market impact and proposed using different measures to substitute or to complement the ADT, such as the average value of transactions (AVT) or the depth of the order book. Some respondents also noted that the proposed yearly calculation fails to take into consideration the erratic variation of liquidity."
classD|"Similarly to the responses received to the DP, respondents expressed concerns about the proposed thresholds for each class of ADT and in particular for less liquid shares (which often are shares issued by small and medium enterprises). In their views, the proposed thresholds would fail to capture a sufficient proportion of the orders as LIS and would entail very high trading costs in particular for the smallest ADT class (according to some responses, transaction costs might reach up to 200 bps for the class below EUR 100,000). ESMA appreciates those concerns and agrees that it is important that LIS thresholds are appropriate and in particular for less liquid shares such as SME shares. ESMA notes that, in the CP’s proposal, the greater level of granularity and the new ADT categories (and related thresholds) which have been added to the current MiFID I regime partially addressed those concerns. It is worth noting in this respect that under MiFID I the threshold for the shares with an ADT lower than EUR 100,000 (and up to EUR 500,000 EUR) is EUR 50,000 whereas under the proposed regime it was set at EUR 30,000."
classD|"However, ESMA appreciates that there is some merit in introducing further granularity into the system in order to better take into consideration the less liquid shares such as SME shares. Therefore, in its final table, ESMA has added a new ADT category for shares with an ADT of less than EUR 50,000 with a corresponding threshold of EUR 15,000. The thresholds for deferred publication have also been modified on that basis."
classF|"Finally, some respondents asked for further clarification with respect to the transactions that should be taken into consideration for the ADT calculations, supporting a broad approach in this respect, i.e. the inclusion of lit, dark and OTC transactions. ESMA confirms that the ADT calculations should include all transactions executed in the relevant financial instrument, regardless whether they are traded on- or off-venue."
classD|"ESMA proposes to establish a single EUR 1,000,000 LIS threshold for all ETFs regardless of their underlying or their liquidity."
classF|"Certificates are defined by MiFIR as transferable securities which are negotiable on the capital market and which, in case of repayment of investment by the issuers, are ranked above shares but below unsecured bond instruments and other similar financial instruments. ESMA identified two types of financial instruments traded in the Union that would be considered certificates under the above definition: Spanish Participationes Preferentes and German Genusscheine."
classF|ESMA remains of the view that certificates have different payoffs from shares and are hence separate financial instruments which ought to be subject to a different transparency regime. ESMA has decided to maintain the table presented in the CP and which is reproduced below.
classG|"In the DP, ESMA evaluated the pros and cons of requiring stubs to meet the relevant LIS threshold following partial execution to continue to be eligible to the LIS waiver. On the one hand, ESMA considered that allowing stubs to remain protected under the LIS waiver would result in a more consistent treatment of the whole order, greater protection for large orders and greater incentive to execute transaction on order books and ultimately in better quality of execution. On the other hand, requiring stubs to be made transparent when falling below the relevant threshold was considered as conducive to greater transparency and consistent with an approach where similar sized orders are, ceteris paribus, subject to equivalent transparency requirements. As a compromise, ESMA’s proposal in the DP was to require stubs to be made transparent only when, following partial execution, the size of the stub would fall below 75% of the relevant LIS threshold."
classF|"ESMA therefore proposed in the CP to clarify that LIS orders may remain protected under the LIS waiver regime even when, following partial execution, they fall below the relevant LIS threshold provided that the price or other relevant conditions for execution are not amended following execution."
